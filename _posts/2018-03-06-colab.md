### Introduction

Colaboratory is a tool from Google that lets you run a Python Notebook in the cloud with a GPU support.
There are some limitations on available memory and time contraints for running a continuous session yet it should be enough to train a decent scale machine learning models.
Here is an overview of the setup process together with a sample notebook that shows how to use Colaboratory to start with deep learning on Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset using Keras.

</p>

### Set-up

The first prerequisite is that you have a Google account and a browser other than Internet Explorer.
You probably do, so open your [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/).
Here, we need to connect the Colaboratory app as shown below.

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="/images/colab/new_connect.png" alt="New-Connect" width="66%">
</p>

Then, search for the phrase `colaboratory` and connect it with your account.

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="/images/colab/connect.png" alt="Connect" width="80%">
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="/images/colab/ok.png" alt="OK" width="60%">
</p>

At this point, you should be able to create new Colaboratory Notebook.

    <img src="/images/colab/new.png" alt="OK" width="66%">
</p>

To enable a GPU support, you need to edit Notebook Settings.

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="/images/colab/settings.png" alt="Settings" width="60%">
</p>

Choose `GPU` option from the Hardware accelerator dropdown list and save the setting.

</p>

Now, you are ready to do some deep learning.

### Deep learning starter notebook

You can start by following a deep learning starter notebook that can be accessed here: [DeepLearningStarter.ipynb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xSIiv8iQDEsdSgjuLE6vOhxFpG-xQC0Q/view?usp=sharing).
It assumes some basic Python programming skills.
This notebook is a step by step guide to solve an image classification task.
It uses the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/), "database of face photographs designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition".
It contains images of famous people, e.g. Bill Clinton:

</p>

The model employed in this task is an all convolutional neural network implemented in [Keras](https://keras.io).
You should be able to achieve results similar (or even better, after tuning some training hyper-parameters) to the ones shown below.
