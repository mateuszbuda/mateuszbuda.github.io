title: "Segmentation of brain tumor in magnetic resonance images"
description: "U-Net like architecture applied to the task of whole tumor segmentation in brain MRI.
Used dataset was obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and involved 110 cases.
To evaluate the quality of segmentation, we used Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) with 22-fold cross-validation.
Achieved performance was 83.60% mean DSC and 87.33% median DSC.
In comparison, DSC of two expert human readers for this kind of tumor is 84% with standard deviation of 2%.
This puts our method on a par with radiologists."
