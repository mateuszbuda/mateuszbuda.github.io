title: "Segmentation of brain tumor in magnetic resonance images"
description: "U-Net like architecture applied to the task of whole tumor segmentation in brain MRI.
The dataset used for development was obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and involved 110 cases of lower-grade glioma patients.
To evaluate the quality of segmentation, we used Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) with 22-fold cross-validation.
The achieved performance was 83.60% mean DSC and 87.33% median DSC.
In comparison, DSC of two expert human readers for this kind of tumor is 84% with a standard deviation of 2%.
This puts our method on a par with radiologists."
